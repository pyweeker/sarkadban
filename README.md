Sokoban remix made with python3.8.5 and arcade library

29th may 2021: solved saving games with different texture inside a same layer ! see troll layer
i will fix diamonds this week end. You can help me to improve a more natural contact when pushing boxes +++
------------------------

28th may 2021:  Play with arrows, press bar if boxes are upon their spoted area to store it definitively.
you can save the player, boxes and static boxes position pressing zero numpad keyboard.

Trolls can be pushed, collision not perfect can go through walls.just drawing  diamonds.


27th May 2021 : boxes sticks to hands , also slippery ground effect for the boxes... 
just one level, short press and release arrows to make it move, press bar when it is placed upon targets.

Goal : place boxes on spotted tiles and press bar to stabilize it. Idem for diamonds on the logo diamond place.
Stabilized forms have inverted colors.
Trolls are just for challenge.
